            <h2>Benvenuti and Welcome to Anna Maria Pasteria</h2>
            <p>
                A mix of modern and traditional Italian cuisine, our cozy ristorante has
                long been a local favorite. Sisters Anna and Maria, originally from the 
                Basilicata region of southern Italy, first opened the doors of Anna Maria 
                Pasteria in 1989.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beginning at age seven, Anna fell in love with cooking, creating her first 
                plate of Pasta e Fagioli, a simple peasant dish which is now an Italian 
                specialty. Enamored with cuisine and hospitality, Maria followed the family 
                tradition and put her heart into making the best and most heavenly Tiramisu. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After nearly two decades, Anna and Maria continue to dedicate themselves to the 
                finest home-made Italian cuisine and service. Each entree is prepared to order 
                with only the finest and freshest ingredients.
            </p>
            <p>
                 It is our desire to make your dinner at Anna Maria Pasteria a delight to your 
                 palate and a happy and memorable dining experience. Thank you for joining us 
                 here on our website and we hope to see you soon.
